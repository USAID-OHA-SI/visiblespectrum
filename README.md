## Overview

The `visiblespectrum` package is currently in development and aims to provide users with easy access to HIV sub-national estimates from the [UNAIDS NAOMI Spectrum tool](https://naomi-spectrum.unaids.org/). The primary function for pulling data is `pull_naomi`, which allows users to specify various parameters to customize their queries.

## Installation

To install the development version of `visiblespectrum`, you can use the `devtools` package. Make sure you have `devtools` installed, then run:

```R
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install visiblespectrum from GitHub
devtools::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/visiblespectrum")
```
## Usage and Parameters
The main function to retrieve data is `pull_naomi`. Users can customize the data retrieval by providing parameters as follows:

```R
pull_naomi(
  countries = "all",   # Character vector, "all", or "dreams"
  indicators = "all",  # Character vector, "all" or "no anc"
  age_groups = "standard", # Character vector or "standard"
  sex_options = "all", # Character vector or "all"
  periods = "recent",  # Character vector or "recent"
  max_level = 5,       # Integer
  verbose = FALSE,     # Logical
  csv = FALSE,         # Logical
  wait = 0             # Numeric
)
```

### Parameters

- **`countries`**: A character vector specifying the countries to include. Options are `"all"` or `"dreams"`.
- **`indicators`**: A character vector for the indicators of interest. Options include `"all"`, `"no anc"`, or a specific list.
- **`age_groups`**: A character vector for the desired age groups. Can be set to `"standard"` or a specific list.
- **`sex_options`**: A character vector specifying the sex options. Defaults to `"all"`.
- **`periods`**: A character vector for the periods of interest. Defaults to `"recent"`.
- **`max_level`**: An integer representing the maximum area level to retrieve data for.
- **`verbose`**: A logical value that controls whether progress messages are printed during data retrieval.
- **`csv`**: A logical value that controls whether the results will be saved as a CSV or not. CSVs save in the current working directory.
- **`wait`**: An optional float parameter that introduces a delay (in seconds) between API requests. This can help reduce errors if too many requests are sent in a short period. Set to `0` for no delay, or to a positive value to wait before each request.

#### Parameter Input Options

Input any of the possible values into a character vector (ensure each value is enclosed in quotes). View the full list of parameters here: [https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/visiblespectrum/blob/main/inst/extdata/all_parameters_summary.csv][all_parameters_summary.csv].

### Example Queries

```R
library(visiblespectrum)

# Pull defaults
defaults_query <- pull_naomi()
View(defaults_query)

# Pull one query for Angola's 15-19 female population in December 2023 and save to CSV
single_inputs_query <- pull_naomi(
  countries = c("Angola"),
  indicators = c("Population"),
  age_groups = c("15-19"),
  sex_options = c("Female"),
  periods = c("December 2023"),
  csv = TRUE
)
View(single_inputs_query)

# Pull ART coverage for DREAMS countries for females aged 15-24 at area levels 0 and 1 with a wait
dreams_art_query <- pull_naomi(
  countries = "dreams", 
  indicators = c("ART coverage"), 
  age_groups = c("15-24"), 
  sex_options = c("Female"), 
  max_level = 1,
  wait = 0.5
)
View(dreams_art_query)

# Pull HIV prevalence for all ages (together) for all genders (together) in all countries at the country (area level 0) level
hiv_prev_country_level_query <- pull_naomi(
  indicators = c("HIV prevalence"),
  age_groups = c("all ages"),
  sex_options = c("Both"),
  max_level = 0
)
View(hiv_prev_country_level_query)

```

### In Development

#### Higher Priority
- Improve graceful error handling for expected data gaps, such as:
  - **Namibia**: Missing PEDS (0-14) data.
  - Some countries missing data for ANC indicators including **`ANC tested negative`** and **`ANC tested positive`**.
- Automatically select and use the most recent available period for all countries.
  - Dig into periods issue and handle Mozambique (see notes)
- Introduce more robust testing procedures.
- Add rerun functionality for fails.

#### Lower Priority
- Add all periods functionality to `pull_naomi`.
- Fix issues with the **progress bar** not showing up when using package (but functioning when running in RStudio as a script).
- Address the warning message regarding **`httr`** and **`progressr`** upon loading.

#### Need More Information
- Create a standard set of input indicators that would be most useful (there are 27 indicators at present and under the default, they are all being run)
  - What should this standard set be?
- Draft more detailed vignettes.
  - What should it/they look like?
- Fix `README` to be more standardized (only necessary if `visiblespectrum` will be separate from `mindthegap`)


### Notes
- **Eswatini** is listed as **`ESW`** in the dataset. The ISO code expected by `countrycode` is **`SWZ`**.
- **Namibia** does not have data for the `0-14` age group, which will result in failures when attempting to retrieve it.
- Several countries do not have data for `ANC Positive`/`ANC Negative` even though in the NAOMI UI they are dropdown options.
- Area levels are 0-based, meaning level 0 represents the country level. When specifying a max level depth, the data will include levels from 0 up to the selected max. For example, setting `max_level = 2` will return data for levels 0 (country), 1, and 2.
- Every country has data for period `December 2023`, which is why it was used for development. All countries have a dropdown option (may not include all data) for `September 2024` (Q3) except for Mozambique, which has the option for `December 2024` (Q4). It appears in future years as well Mozambique is one quarter later than all other countries.
- `pull_naomi` and `validate_parameters` are external methods.
