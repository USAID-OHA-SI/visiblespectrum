# ðŸŒˆ visiblespectrum ðŸŒˆ




**A package to scrape the UNAIDS NAOMI Spectrum HIV sub-national estimates viewer.**

## Overview

The `visiblespectrum` package is currently in development and aims to provide users with easy access to HIV sub-national estimates from the UNAIDS NAOMI Spectrum tool. The primary function for pulling data is `pull_naomi`, which allows users to specify various parameters to customize their queries.

## Installation

To install the development version of `visiblespectrum`, you can use the `devtools` package. Make sure you have `devtools` installed, then run:

```R
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install visiblespectrum from GitHub
devtools::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/visiblespectrum")
```
## Usage
The main function to retrieve data is pull_naomi. Users can customize the data retrieval by providing parameters as follows:

```R
pull_naomi(
  countries = "all",   # Options: a list, "standard", or "dreams"
  indicators = "all",  # Options: a list or "standard"
  age_groups = "standard", # Options: a list or "standard"
  sex_options = "all", # Options: a list or "recent"
  periods = "recent",  # Options: a list or "recent"
  max_level = "none",  # Integer indicating the maximum area level depth
  verbose = FALSE      # Logical indicating whether to print progress messages
)
```
## Parameters

- **countries**: A character vector specifying the countries to include. Options are "all", "standard", or "dreams".
- **indicators**: A character vector for the indicators of interest. Options include "all" or a specific list.
- **age_groups**: A character vector for the desired age groups. Can be set to "standard" or a specific list.
- **sex_options**: A character vector specifying the sex options. Defaults to "all".
- **periods**: A character vector for the periods of interest. Defaults to "recent".
- **max_level**: An integer representing the maximum area level to retrieve data for.
- **verbose**: A logical value that controls whether progress messages are printed during data retrieval.

### In Development:
- Improve error handling for expected data gaps, such as:
  - **Namibia**: Missing pediatric (PEDS) data.
  - Some countries missing data for **ANC tested negative** and **ANC tested positive**.
- Implement checks to ensure the user's input parameters are valid, and provide suggestions if not.
- Automatically select and use the most recent available period for all countries.
- Introduce more robust testing procedures.
- Draft more detailed vignettes.
- Fix issues with the **progress bar** not showing up when using package (but functioning when running in RStudio as a script).
- Resolve Shiny-related issues in the Input Tables vignette (Shiny not functioning as a vignette).
- Address the warning message regarding **httr** and **progressr** upon loading.
- Create a standard set of input indicators that would be most useful (there are 27 indicators at present and under the default, they are all being run)

### Notes:
- **Eswatini** is listed as **ESW** in the dataset. The ISO code expected by `countrycode` is **SWZ**.
- **Namibia** does not have data for the 0-14 age group, which will result in failures when attempting to retrieve it.
- Several countries do not have data for ANC Positive/ANC Negative even though in the NAOMI UI they are dropdown options.
